Hello, my name is Nathan Ilescas. I'm a Computer Science major at MiraCosta College, and I’m excited to start this DSA course to dive deeper into the techniques and methods used in software development. I’ve been programming for about three years, primarily through self-study, and have created several personal projects. I'm thrilled to learn new techniques that I can apply to my future programs
